# Easy File Creator (EFC)
EFC is a CLI application that helps create a template file of any programing language.

The software is easy to use, for example typing `efc file example python` in your console you will create a file named `example.py` or better than this
typing `efc project example python` you will create a Python project with a `Main.py` file and others things inside, like `requirements.txt`.

The software is really tiny, powerfull and totaly made with python! It only consume less than 20Kb at Linux systems.
