# Lua version of project?

Yeah, I'm trying to use a fastest programing language
for the project, Lua is perfect to file manipulation
and is smaller and fastest than Python.

for while the project isn't done yet, and beacuse this
dont have any install tutorial or something like it.

If you are smart, I actualy hope you should be,
you may install and test for yourself. :blink:
